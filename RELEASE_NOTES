## Known issues
Panda-Tray:
- In settings dialog, Apply doesn't disable after clicking cancel
- Tabbing in settings dialog doesn't work right (not jumping to buttons after text)
- In settings dialog, first textbox should be selected by default
- Event handling is just bloody crazy right now! Need to refactor UI code
- Downloads don't resume - doesn't show upload/download status
- Quitting the panda - background downloads keep going
- Not working with Unity on Ubuntu
- Password is being stored in clear text!
- Installer fails if already installed and running
- If you quit the panda - while it's upgrading - it keeps running in the background until
	the upgrade is complete. If you try to start up the panda while it's upgrading, it
	won't start. You have to wait until the update is complete, and then start the panda.
	That's a silly yourney - the users shouldn't have to worry about that!
- If you delete the local directory, but have placed new files in that directory remotely,
	then the remote files get removed. Appropriate action would be to retain files that
	have not been downloaded yet, by downloading them - and retaining directory structure as
	far as is valid
- The setup program isn't signed - so Windows 8 complains
- The autoupdate feature, on Windows 8 requires promping to complete
- On first run, on windows 8, security issue causes prompting
- Upload speed not showing
- Must check md5 hash on upload!
- Download is not downloading complete file!

## Missing features
Panda-Tray:
- Favourites (link to digital panda should be added)
- I think the panda should ask before updating - but that can wait until we have something more stable
- Status: speed uploading, files up to date etc.
- Look if there's a better way to detect online changes than iterating through everything
- Double click the panda, should open panda folder
- Account settings should be an additinoal tab away
