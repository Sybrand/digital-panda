## Known issues
Panda-Tray:
- In settings dialog, Apply doesn't disable after clicking cancel
- Tabbing in settings dialog doesn't work right (not jumping to buttons after text)
- In settings dialog, first textbox should be selected by default
- Event handling is just bloody crazy right now! Need to refactor UI code
- Downloads don't resume
- Not working with Unity on Ubuntu
- Password is being stored in clear text!
- Installer fails if already installed and running
- If you quit the panda - while it's upgrading - it keeps running in the background until
	the upgrade is complete. If you try to start up the panda while it's upgrading, it
	won't start. You have to wait until the update is complete, and then start the panda.
	That's a silly yourney - the users shouldn't have to worry about that!
- If you delete the local directory, but have placed new files in that directory remotely,
	then the remote files get removed. Appropriate action would be to retain files that
	have not been downloaded yet, by downloading them - and retaining directory structure as
	far as is valid
- The autoupdate feature, on Windows 8 requires promping to complete
- On first run, on windows 8, security issue causes prompting
- Upload speed not showing
- Not handling 403 on auth correctly.

## Missing features
Panda-Tray:
- Favourites (link to digital panda should be added)
- I think the panda should ask before updating - but that can wait until we have something more stable
- Status: speed uploading, files up to date etc.
- Look if there's a better way to detect online changes than iterating through everything
- Double click the panda, should open panda folder
- Account settings should be an additional tab away
- Restart application after update, should only happen if dialog not showing
- Instead of overwriting remote file, copy to Trash folder in the same container
- Empty trash

## Panda-Tray:

0.16
* Bug fixes:
- Was not handling pure pseudo directories correctly (resulting in infinite download/delete/download... loop)
- Completely replaced how the auto update works
CURRENT: testing auto-update
WHERE I LEFT OF: got it to update from localhost - running:
C:\Users\Sybrand\repos\digital-panda\AutoUpdatePy>python auto_update.pyw localhost
NEXT: running the panda, from it's shortcut, get it to do an autoupdate
NEXT NEXT: then create and sign installer (document this step!)


0.15
* New functionality
- Now handling multiple accounts - files are stored under /DigitalPanda/Username
- Instead of deleting remote files, they get moved to Trash folder in the same container
- If there were any changes remotely, or locally, panda immediately looks for work without resting
- Database version now matches software version - this to ensure that upgrading/downgrading won't
	break things. (The down side is a re-indexing when you upgrade - meaning things are a bit slow
	when you upgrade)
- Only doing cleanup after upgrade, in order to limit super user calls
- Make all the gfx very ugly, by pasting alpha on everything
- Restart after update
- Get updates depending on configuration - to allow for dev/qa testing of updates
